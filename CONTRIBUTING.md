# Contributing Guidelines

We are truly grateful for any PRs you open, and we assure you of our welcoming and respectful approach. We will review and consider all PRs, valuing the diverse contributions, but we donâ€™t guarantee that all proposed changes will be merged into the core.

The most desirable PRs are:

- Bug fixes for existing features
- Enhancements that improve compatibility with different system versions, browsers, PHP or WP versions, WordPress plugins, or environments in general.

We recommend [adding an issue](https://github.com/Automattic/studio/issues/new/choose) for new features so we can review the plan before you start work on the PR.
