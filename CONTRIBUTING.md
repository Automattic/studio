### Reporting General Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Automattic/studio/issues/new/choose).

### Pull Requests

We are truly grateful for any pull requests you open, and we assure you of our welcoming and respectful approach. We will review and consider all pull requests, valuing the diverse contributions, but we don’t guarantee that all proposed changes will be merged into the core.

The most desirable pull requests are:

- Enhancements that improve compatibility with different system versions, browsers, PHP or WP versions, WordPress plugins, or environments in general.

We recommend [adding an issue](https://github.com/Automattic/studio/issues/new/choose) for new features so we can review the plan before you start work on the pull request.
