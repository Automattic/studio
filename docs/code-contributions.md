# Code Contributions

## Development

### Required Dependencies

Before you can build and run the app, you need to install the following dependencies:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - required JavaScript runtime environment.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - required for building native dependencies.
- [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) - required for building native dependencies.

Many project contributors rely upon [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to manage Node.js and Python installations respectively.

If you manage packages with Homebrew you can do the following:

```bash
brew install python3 python-setuptools
```

`nvm` commands referenced in the remaining documentation operate under the assumption that installed Node.js versions are managed with `nvm`. To use the correct Node.js version and install the project dependencies, run the following commands:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
```

### Running the App

Once all required dependencies are installed[^1], you can run the app with the following command:

[^1]: Whenever project dependencies are updated, you may need to run `npm install` again before running the app.

```bash
npm start
```

The app automatically launches with the Chromium developer tools opened by default. Changes to the "renderer" process code will automatically reload the app, changes to the main process code require a manual server restart or [typing `rs`](https://www.electronforge.io/cli#start) into the same terminal where the server was started.

### Project Structure

The following represents notable pieces of project structure:

- `scripts/` - scripts for building and testing the app.
- `src/` - the source code for the app.
- `src/index.ts` - the entry point for the main process.
- `src/renderer.ts` - the entry point for the "renderer," the code running in the Chromium window.
- `vendor/wp-now` - the modified `wp-now` source code.

### Code Formatting

Code formatting is set up to make merging pull requests easier. It uses the same Prettier/ESLint mechanism as Calypso. See [JavaScript Coding Guidelines](https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/trunk/docs/coding-guidelines/javascript.md) for guidance on setting up your editor for code formatting.

### CLI Development

The CLI relies upon a separate instance of the app to run. When developing the CLI, the CLI can be invoked with the following steps:

- Run `npm start` to launch the first instance of the app.
- Within the `forge.config.ts` file, change the `WebpackPlugin` ports used for the second instance:
  - Set the development `port` to `3457`.
  - Add a `loggerPort` property set to `9001`.
- Run `npm start -- -- --cli"=<CLI-COMMAND>"` in separate terminal session.

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Automated unit tests can be run with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or to run tests in "watch" mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### End-to-End Tests

Automated end-to-end (E2E) tests are also available. To run them, clean the `out/` directory and build the fresh app binary:

```bash
npm run make
```

Then run tests:

```bash
npm run e2e
```

## Debugging

The renderer process can be debugged using the Chromium developer tools. To open the developer tools, press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on Mac or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on Windows.

The React tree in the renderer process can be debugged with the standalone [React Developer Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools#safari-and-other-browsers). To do this, start the the React Developer Tools and then start the app with the `REACT_DEV_TOOLS=true` flag set.

```bash
npx react-devtools
REACT_DEV_TOOLS=true npm start
```

The main process can be debugged using the Node.js inspector. To do this, run the app with the `--inspect-brk-electron` flag:

```bash
npm start -- --inspect-brk-electron
```

Then open `chrome://inspect` in a Chromium-based browser and click "inspect" next to the process you want to debug.

## Building Installers

Once all required dependencies are installed[^2], you can build installers for the app.
Installers can currently be built on Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon) and Windows with the following command:

[^2]: Whenever project dependencies are updated, you may need to run `npm install` again before building the installers.

```bash
npm run make
```
